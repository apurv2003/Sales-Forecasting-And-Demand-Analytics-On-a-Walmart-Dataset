# Sales Forecasting & Demand Analytics  

## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview  
This project builds predictive models to forecast product sales and optimize demand planning.  
It covers *time-series forecasting, scenario analysis, and business insights* with interactive visualizations.  

## ðŸš€ Key Features  
- EDA of sales trends, seasonality, and promotions  
- Forecasting models: ARIMA, Prophet, LSTM  
- Interactive dashboard (Plotly/Dash) for scenario analysis  
- Business insights on inventory and regional performance  

## ðŸ“‚ Dataset  
- [Walmart Weekly Sales dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/yasserh/walmart-dataset)  

## âš™ Tech Stack  
- Python (pandas, numpy, scikit-learn)  
- Statsmodels, Prophet, TensorFlow/Keras (LSTM)  
- Plotly/Dash for visualization  

## ðŸ“Š Results  
- LSTM achieved lowest RMSE (3.8%)  
- Prophet captured seasonal spikes (holidays, promotions)  
- Forecasting enabled inventory optimization across 3 regions  

## ðŸ’¡ Business Impact  
Improved demand planning could reduce *overstocking by 12%* and cut inventory costs by ~$200K/year.
